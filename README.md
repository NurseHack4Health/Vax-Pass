# Vax Pass

### Description
Vax Pass is a vaccine passport application that secures (through encryption) and verifies protected health information (PHI), and vaccination course status of a child or young adult in a QR code. The aim is to facilitate the resumption of physical and social activities of children and young adults prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Technology
Vax Pass uses a decentralized approach in the storage of PHI and health processes or status (i.e. vaccination course status) using encrypted information in the QR code. The individual can then obtain a physical copy of the QR, or have the link to the QR code electronically sent through email. This eliminates the need to sign up in any application portal or platform. Unlike blockchain technology where decentralization is done through distributed systems across a network, data autonomy and responsibility is shifted to the individual since information in the QR is not stored in any central database.
